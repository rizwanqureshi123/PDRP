## System preparation ##

#Download frcmod.mod_phipsi.1 file and save in working dir.

In xLeap:

complex = loadpdb " pdb_file_name.pdb"

saveamberparm complex complex.prmtop complex.inpcrd
saveamberparm complex complex_vac.prmtop complex_vac.inpcrd

charge complex
addions complex Na+ 0
addions complex Cl- 0
#add again
addions complex Na+ 0
solvateoct complex TIP3PBOX 10.0
saveamberparm complex complex_sol.prmtop complex_sol.inpcrd


Now you will get topology and co-ordinate file and start the MD Simulation
